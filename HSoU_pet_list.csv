- Friendly, active canine companions who are similar to my own size & energy level to help keep me busy!
- A secure yard, with supervision outside.

Look no further than Tripp! He is a fantastic big black lab who is housebroken, good with dogs of all sizes and temperaments, cats, and kids of all sizes. Tripp is a wonderful house dog-- quiet and well behaved, spends most of his daytime hours chilling on the couch or bed, or sitting at your heel. His go-to move is to walk along at your heel wherever you go and sit quietly at heel when you stop. 
While Tripp is a mellow housedog, he is an active guy outside. He loves to play in the snow and wrestle other dogs, bark at the neighbor dogs, or go for walks on or off-leash. Because Tripp has some separation anxiety, he needs to go to a home with another dog to keep him company.

Terrific Tripp is the whole package: handsome, affectionate, obedient, fun, and companionable. For more information about him or to meet him, contact the Foster Dept at 801-261-2919 x215. His adoption fee is $60 which includes this year's vaccinations (excluding rabies), deworming, neuter, microchip, a certificate for a free exam with a participating local veterinarian, and a slip leash to take him home.",TRIPP

I am a ""special needs adoption"" because I have a conformational defect in my legs. I'm told I have crooked tibias & weak ligaments in both of my knees.

My adopters should be aware that I may be more of a financial commitment than an animal without special needs.

Although my history is a mystery, I like the people & other dogs I have met here at HSU. It is unknown if I have been around cats or children before. I may or may not be fully house trained…some of us transfer animals have lived our entire lives in a loving home environment, while others have never lived indoors or been part of a family. I can tell you that we are all very eager to learn!

I may need some guidance & a healthy dose of patience while I'm learning the ropes. A regular daily routine, positive reinforcement, crate training & exercise will help me learn to be the very best canine companion I can be! If you do decide to take me home, the behavior staff at HSU is here to help me succeed, so feel free to contact them if you need help!

Although my history is a mystery, I like the people & other dogs I have met here at HSU. It is unknown if I have been around cats or children before. I may or may not be fully house trained…some of us transfer animals have lived our entire lives in a loving home environment, while others have never lived indoors or been part of a family. I can tell you that we are all very eager to learn!

I may need some guidance & a healthy dose of patience while I'm learning the ropes. A regular daily routine, positive reinforcement, crate training & exercise will help me learn to be the very best canine companion I can be! If you do decide to take me home, the behavior staff at HSU is here to help me succeed, so feel free to contact them if you need help!

If you think we're a match, please bring your family (including other dogs) to The Humane Society of Utah to meet me today!

My temporary home is:
